# seabirds
Functions to work with seabird tracking data, in particular to identify marine IBAs based on Lascelles et al (2016).

These functions were originally developed by Phil Taylor and Mark Miller, but had to be updated to streamline code, improve computational efficiency, and overcome obsolete or redundant functions that are no longer supported in newer R versions (>2.5.0)
