In the batchUD function, there are frequent errors due to the 'grid too small'. This is a misnomer, because usually the grid is not too small, but the grid CELL SIZE is too small, so increasing grid from 100 to 1000 makes things worse.
To fix it we should reduce the extent.

These lines need to be fixed and tested against all possible datasets:

Ext <- (min(coordinates(TripCoords)[,1]) + 3 * diff(range(coordinates(TripCoords)[,1])))
if(Ext < (Scale * 1000 * 2)) {BExt <- ceiling((Scale * 1000 * 3)/(diff(range(coordinates(TripCoords)[,1]))))} else {BExt <- 5}
